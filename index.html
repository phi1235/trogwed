    <em>Since the tour in Nha Trang</em>
    </b>
    <hr>
<br>My first visit to Nha Trang, the coastal city, was three years ago. <br>It was a pleasant and memorable trip. Nha Trang, the capital of Khanhs Hoaf province, has one of the most popular municipal beaches in all of Vietnam.<br> In Nha Trang, nature beauties are so tempting. Waves crashing onto the cliffs; the soft sigh of the sea breeze; clean white sands and turquoise waters; it all makes for a stunning landscapes.<br> On my visit to Nha Trang, I used to get up early each morning to stroll along the beach a chance to breath in the fresh sea air and enjoy the sunrise across the water.<br> One attraction that captivated me three years ago and still it does is the collection of small offshore islands.<br> Hon Tre is the largest of the islands, and Monkey island is, as the name suggests, the home of hundreds of wild monkeys.<br> Yen island is known for its swifts’ nests. Nha Trang is the city in hamoney: its fine weather, favorite position and friendly people bring it a cerain balance. Nha Trang is a great holiday destination.<br> I hope to have chance to come back.
